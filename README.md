### Data Engineering Pipeline

#### 1. Data Extraction & Cleaning
```dax
-- Total Sales calculation from dashboard
Total Sales = SUMX(Sales, Sales[Item_MRP] * Sales[Unit_Sales])
-- Result: $1.20M across all outlets

-- Average Sales per transaction
Avg Sales = DIVIDE([Total Sales], COUNT(Sales[Transaction_ID]))
-- Result: $141 per transaction

-- Customer rating analysis with filtering
Average Rating = AVERAGEX(
    FILTER(Sales, Sales[Outlet_Rating] <> BLANK()), 
    Sales[Outlet_Rating]
)
-- Result: Consistent 3.9/5.0 across all outlet types

-- Fat content performance analysis
Regular Fat Sales = 
CALCULATE(
    [Total Sales],
    Products[Item_Fat_Content] = "Regular"
)
-- Result: $776.32K (64.6% market share)

-- Geographic performance ranking
Tier Performance = 
SWITCH(
    TRUE(),
    [Outlet_Location_Type] = "Tier 3", $472.13K,
    [Outlet_Location_Type] = "Tier 2", $393.15K,
    [Outlet_Location_Type] = "Tier 1", $336.40K
